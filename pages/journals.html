    <h2>J.R Carpenter, The Handmade Web</h2>
    <p>On the information J. R. Carpenter tells a biological short story back in the 90’s of coding handwritten website before there was typing in software. If I went back in time in the 90’s, I would do the handwritten code if I could write then understand my handwriting. But I want to be what retro software in 90’s is to type the code handwritten. Good to see a hyperlink in the paragraphs of the online archive. Curious how long will it take a to make a handwritten code and type it in and publish it to the web? </p>

    <h2>Becca Abbe, The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement</h2>
    <p>When reading “The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement” by Becca Abbe, I think these talks about what they created rises but soon eventually falls. I look up the “Club of Rome” and one of the founders is “David Rockefeller” and he live over 100 years. In the early 70’s they developed engineered program to categories which soon went down in 1972. The are some sentences saying have choice to whether pick side or what would rather do.</p>

    <h2>Frank Chimero, The Good Room</h2>
    <p>I’ve read most of the reading and I don’t think I ever remembering learning about history of the New York Public Library. And when in the late 1800s when started building it and in the early 1900s it was completed and open. I trying to understand the comparison of two historic architecture telling of how technology is residing where is consider staying in place. And the telling like search engines and social media like “Google” and “Facebook” are not technology anymore but now a media institute.</p>

    <h2>Teayoon Choi, Hello World!</h2>
    <p>This reading talks about how the writer talks about experience and knowledge of a handmade computer. I read some things of maybe talking about comparing of computers to the real world and mentioning basics of GUI software like coding language and abstraction of textures, revealing objects and shadows. It made me wonder if there is another course on computer programming or maybe a club on software featuring GUI. And the mention practice and repetition when breaking down to turn them to easy operations. I wonder if a handmade computer can also be a gaming computer.</p>
