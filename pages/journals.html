    <h2>J.R Carpenter, The Handmade Web</h2>
    <p>On the information J. R. Carpenter tells a biological short story back in the 90’s of coding handwritten website before there was typing in software. If I went back in time in the 90’s, I would do the handwritten code if I could write then understand my handwriting. But I want to be what retro software in 90’s is to type the code handwritten. Good to see a hyperlink in the paragraphs of the online archive. Curious how long will it take a to make a handwritten code and type it in and publish it to the web? </p>

    <h2>Becca Abbe, The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement</h2>
    <p>When reading “The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement” by Becca Abbe, I think these talks about what they created rises but soon eventually falls. I look up the “Club of Rome” and one of the founders is “David Rockefeller” and he live over 100 years. In the early 70’s they developed engineered program to categories which soon went down in 1972. The are some sentences saying have choice to whether pick side or what would rather do.</p>
