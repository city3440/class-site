    <h2>J.R Carpenter, The Handmade Web</h2>
    <p>On the information J. R. Carpenter tells a biological short story back in the 90’s of coding handwritten website before there was typing in software. If I went back in time in the 90’s, I would do the handwritten code if I could write then understand my handwriting. But I want to be what retro software in 90’s is to type the code handwritten. Good to see a hyperlink in the paragraphs of the online archive. Curious how long will it take a to make a handwritten code and type it in and publish it to the web? </p>
